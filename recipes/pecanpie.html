            <h2>Home Baked Pecan Pie</h2>
                <p>I don’t typically bake pies all year round. I suppose I reserve my pie baking for special occasions and holidays. I’m not really sure why that is, because they really aren’t difficult to make, especially the recipe that I am going to share with you today, this Classic EASY Pecan Pie recipe!</p>
                <p>This Pecan Pie recipe is so quick, I should really make it a year-round dessert. Because while Pecan Pie is just about as important to your Thanksgiving meal as the turkey, I kind of feel like it should get some love on a random Wednesday in March as well. Let’s make it happen!</p>
